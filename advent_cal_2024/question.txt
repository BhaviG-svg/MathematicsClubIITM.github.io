Pranjal has a challenge for Achintya. Let $\varepsilon$ denote the non-terminating decimal expansion of a fraction (Take 1/4 as an example, its $\varepsilon$ is $0.24\overline{9}$). Pranjal asks him to write the $\varepsilon$ of $\frac{1}{k}$, for any natural number $k>1$. \\
Achintya is then required to find the number of digits in the non-repeating part of $\varepsilon$. (It is 2 (0.$\textbf{24}$999) in the case of $\frac{1}{4}$). Can you help him? \\
What would be the number of digits in the non-repeating part of $\varepsilon$ for k = $2^{1234}\times3^{2345}\times4^{3456}\times5^{4567}$
